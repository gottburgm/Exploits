* If installing in a version before JBoss 4.0.4, you should leave javassist.jar and common-softvaluehashmap.jar in place in this folder.

*If installing in jboss 4.0.4 or later, the classes contained in javassist.jar and common-softvaluehashmap.jar will already be available,
and you should do the following to avoid versioning conflicts:
-delete common-softvaluehashmap.jar
-move javassist.jar to ../../lib/javassist.jar
