<!--
The cache-between-transactions element tells the EJB container whether
to cache the persistent data of an entity bean across (between)
transactions.

When a value of 'true' is specified caching between transactions is
enabled and long term caching of data is performed.  If a value of
'false' is specified, (the default) short term caching is done, which
means that data is only cached during an individual transaction.  A
value of 'true' is only allowed if the concurrency-strategy for a bean
is either Exclusive, ReadOnly, or Optimistic.

A ReadOnly bean simply ignores the value of the
cache-between-transactions element since long term caching of readonly
data is always performed.

When long term caching is enabled for Exclusive concurrency, the EJB
container must have exclusive update access to the underlying data,
i.e. the data must not be updated by another application outside of
the EJB container.  If an Exclusive bean is deployed in a cluster, long
term caching is disabled automatically because any node in the cluster
may update the data, making long term caching impossible.  (Note: In
releases prior to WLS 7.0, this feature was controlled using the
db-is-shared element.)

When long term caching is enabled for Optimistic concurrency, the EJB
container reuses cached values from previous transactions, but ensures
that updates are transactionally consistent by checking for optimistic
conflicts at the end of the transaction.  In addition, notifications
for updates of optimistic data are broadcast to other cluster members
to help avoid optimistic conflicts.

Used in: entity-cache, entity-cache-ref

Default value: false

<!--
The concurrency-strategy specifies how the container should manage concurrent 
access to an entity bean.

The concurrent-strategy can be one of the following values:
  - "Exclusive":  The exclusive locking scheme used in WebLogic 
                  Server versions 3.1 through 5.1
  - "Database":   A scheme where a separate Entity Bean instance is 
                  allocated for each transaction and the locking and
                  caching is handled by the database.
  - "ReadOnly" :  For read-only entity beans

  - "Optimistic" : When using optimistic concurrency, no locks are
                   held in the EJB container or database during a
                   transaction.  The EJB container verifies that none
                   of the data that was updated by a transaction has
                   changed before committing the transaction.  If any
                   updated data has been changed, the transaction is
                   rolled back.

<!--
This parameter specifies the JNDI name of the JMS ConnectionFactory
that the MessageDriven Bean should look up to create its Queues and Topics.
If not specified, it will default to weblogic.jms.MessageDrivenBeanConnectionFactory,
which must have been declared in config.xml.

<!--
Each Message-Driven EJB listens on an associated JMS destination.  If
the JMS destination is located on another WebLogic Server instance or
a foreign JMS provider, it is possible that the JMS destination will
become unreachable.  In this case, the EJB container automatically
attempts to reconnect to the JMS Server.  Once the JMS Server is up
again, the Message-Driven EJB can again receive JMS messages.

The jms-polling-interval-seconds determines the number of seconds
between each attempt to reconnect to the JMS destination.

Default value: 10 seconds

Example:

<jms-polling-interval-seconds>5</jms-polling-interval-seconds>

Since: WebLogic Server 6.1

-->
<!ELEMENT jms-polling-interval-seconds (#PCDATA)>

<!--

The JMS specification allows JMS consumers to specify an associated
id.  This id is necessary for durable subscriptions to
JMS topics.

A Message-Driven EJB with a durable subscription needs an associated
client id.  If a separate connection factory is used, the
client id can be set on the connection factory.  In this case,
the Message-Driven EJB uses this client id.

If the associated connection factory does not have a client id
(or you are using the default connection factory), the Message-Driven
EJB uses the jms-client-id value as its client id.

Default:

  The default client identifier is the ejb-name for this EJB.

<jms-client-id>MyClientID</jms-client-id>

<!--
The ejb-name element specifies an enterprise bean's name. This name is
assigned by the ejb-jar file producer to name the enterprise bean in
the ejb-jar file's deployment descriptor. The name must be unique
among the names of the enterprise beans in the same ejb-jar file. The
enterprise bean code does not depend on the name; therefore the name
can be changed during the application-assembly process without
breaking the enterprise bean's function. There is no architected
relationship between the ejb-name in the deployment descriptor and the
JNDI name that the Deployer will assign to the enterprise bean's home.
The name must conform to the lexical rules for an NMTOKEN.

<!--
The entity-cache-ref element is used to refer to an application level
entity cache, which can cache instances of multiple entity beans that
are part of the same application.  Application level entity caches are
declared in the weblogic-application.xml descriptor.

The entity-cache-name element must contain the name of the application
level cache.

The concurrency-strategy element defines the type of concurrency used by
the bean.  The concurrency-strategy must be compatible with the application
level cache's caching strategy.  For example, an 'Exclusive' cache only
supports beans with a concurrency-strategy of Exclusive.  While, a 
'MultiVersion' cache supports the Database, ReadOnly, and Optimistic
concurrency strategies.

<!--
The entity-cache-name element is used to name the application level

<!-- 
The estimated-bean-size element is used to specify the estimated
average size of the instances of an entity bean in bytes.  This is the
average number of bytes of memory that is consumed by each instance.

The estimated-bean-size is used when the size of the application level
cache that is being used to cache the beans is also specified in terms
of bytes or megabytes.  The estimated-bean-size limits the maximum
number of instances that may exist in the cache at any one time.

Although an application deployer/developer probably does not know the
exact number of bytes that will be consumed by the instances of an
entity bean, specifying a size allows him/her to give some relative
weight to the beans that are sharing a cache.  For example, suppose
that beans A and B share a cache 'AB-cache' that has a size of 1000
bytes.  And suppose that the size of A is 10 and that the size of B is
20 bytes.  Then the cache can hold at most 100 instances of A or 50
instances of B at any one time (100*10 = 50*20 = 1000).  If 100
instances of A are cached, this implies that 0 instances of B are
cached.

The idempotent-methods element contains a list of methods which are written
such that repeated calls to the same method with the same arguments has
exactly the same effect as a single call. This allows the failover handler

on the failed server. Enabling this for a method makes it possible for the
bean stub to automatically recover from any failure as long as another server
hosting the bean can be reached.

Note: Idempotent method settings are only used if clustering is enabled for
the EJB.  To enable clustering for your EJB, see the entity-clustering,
stateless-clustering and stateful-session-clustering elements in this DTD.

Applies to bean managed persistence or EJB 1.1 container-managed
persistence entity EJBs. EJB 2.0 entity EJBs do not need to implement
an is-modified-method. The EJB container can automatically detect
which fields were modified in a transaction.

This parameter declares the name of an EJBean method that tells the
container whether the bean data has been modified. The method is
called when the bean managed EJBean is stored. If a method is not specified,
WebLogic always assumes that the EJBean has been modified and always
saves it. Providing a method and setting it as appropriate will

Specify a transaction isolation level
 
The value of this element must be one of the following:

Special value for use with Oracle DBMS Only:

   TRANSACTION_READ_COMMITTED_FOR_UPDATE

   When this Isolation level is set for a method, the following happens:

     The Isolation Level is set to: TRANSACTION_READ_COMMITTED

     For duration of the Transaction, all SQL 'SELECT' statements
       executed in any method are executed with 'FOR UPDATE' 
       appended to them.  This causes the SELECTed rows to be locked for update.

   This isolation level can be used to avoid the error:
       java.sql.SQLException: ORA-08177: can't serialize access for this transaction

     which can happen when using the TRANSACTION_SERIALIZABLE isolation with Oracle DBMS




Special value for use with Oracle DBMS Only:

   TRANSACTION_READ_COMMITTED_FOR_UPDATE_NO_WAIT

   When this Isolation level is set for a method, the following happens:

       In contrast to the TRANSACTION_READ_COMMITTED_FOR_UPDATE setting
       noted previously, this setting: TRANSACTION_READ_COMMITTED_FOR_UPDATE_NO_WAIT

The run-as-identity-principal element specifies which security principal is
to be used for the run-as identity.  This tag is necessary if the role 
specified in the run-as element of the ejb-jar.xml descriptor does not map to 
a single security principal representing a User in the security realm.  This
could be true in two cases.  One case is where the role maps to multiple
security principals (see security-role-assignment element).  In this case,
the run-as-identity-principal element must be used to specify which of the 
security principals you would like to be used.  The other case is where the 
role maps to a single security principal that represents a Group in the 
security realm.  In this case the run-as-identity-principal element must be

If home-is-clusterable is "True" and this parameter is also "true",
calls to this bean stub will be load-balanced between all the
the servers on which this bean is deployed, and if a server
hosting the bean becomes unreachable, the call will automatically
failover to another server hosting the bean.

The value should be set to "True" only if the bean is written
such that repeated calls to the same method with the same arguments
has exactly the same effect as a single call. This allows the failover
handler to retry a failed call without knowing whether the call
actually completed on the failed server. Setting this property to
"true" makes it possible for the bean stub to automatically recover
from any failure as long as another server hosting the bean can be
reached.
