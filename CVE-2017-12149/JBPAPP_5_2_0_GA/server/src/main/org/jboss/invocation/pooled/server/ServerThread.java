 * This Thread object hold a single Socket connection to a client

 * PooledInvoker's LRU cache.
 *
 * There is also a separate thread pool that is used if the client disconnects.
 * This thread/object is re-used in that scenario and that scenario only.

 * *NOTES* ObjectStreams were found to be better performing than the Custom marshalling
 * done by the TrunkInvoker.
