/**
 * <tt>NotificationWrapper</tt> is a "wide" read only interface 
 * providing "unstructured" access to agent internals and paylod carried by 
 * notifications.
 *
 * The alternatives were:
 *
 * 1.   Precompile assumptions regarding the notification stucture and its 
 *      payload in the trap factory
 * 2.   Use introspection but with a potential large execution overhead. 
 *
 * The use of delegated wrappers stands somewhere in the middle. Trap
 * factory can be extended with the definition and use of new wpappers
 * that will be able to cope with any kind of notfications. Run time overhead
 * is minimal as wrappers can be instantiated only once.
 *
 * Tags used to locate attributes in the notification fixed (i.e. excluding
 * user defined fields) payload are defined. Implementations should not use 
 * these tags in any of the notification payload. To avoid conflicts the 
 * following convention is proposed: standard notification payload is qualified 
 * by the "n:" prefix. Agent properties are qualified by the "a:" prefix. User 
 * defined payload can be qualified with e.g. the "u:" prefix
