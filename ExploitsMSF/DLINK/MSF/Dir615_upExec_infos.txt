  "DESCRIPTION" => "\n\n          Some D-Link Routers are vulnerable to an authenticated OS command injection on\n\n        their web interface, where default credentials are admin/admin or admin/password.\n\n        Since it is a blind os command injection vulnerability, there is no output for the\n\n        executed command when using the cmd generic payload. This module was tested against\n\n        a DIR-615 hardware revision H1 - firmware version 8.04. A ping command against a\n\n        controlled system could be used for testing purposes. The exploit uses the wget\n\n        client from the device to convert the command injection into an arbitrary payload\n\n        execution.\n\n      ",
