  DESCRIPTION => "\n\n          This module exploits a vulnerability found in Symantec Web Gateway's HTTP\n\n        service.  By injecting PHP code in the access log, it is possible to load it\n\n        with a directory traversal flaw, which allows remote code execution under the\n\n        context of 'apache'. Please note that it may take up to several minutes to\n\n        retrieve access_log, which is about the amount of time required to see a shell\n\n        back.\n\n      ",
