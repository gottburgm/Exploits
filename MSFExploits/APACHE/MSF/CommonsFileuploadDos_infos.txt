  CVE => "CVE-2014-0050",
  DESCRIPTION => "

        This module triggers an infinite loop in Apache Commons FileUpload 1.0

        through 1.3 via a specially crafted Content-Type header.

        Apache Tomcat 7 and Apache Tomcat 8 use a copy of FileUpload to handle

        mime-multipart requests, therefore, Apache Tomcat 7.0.0 through 7.0.50

        and 8.0.0-RC1 through 8.0.1 are affected by this issue. Tomcat 6 also

        uses Commons FileUpload as part of the Manager application.
