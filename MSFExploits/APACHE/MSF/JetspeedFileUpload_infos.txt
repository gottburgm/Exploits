my $EXPLOIT = {
  CVE => "CVE-2016-0709",
  DESCRIPTION => "

        This module exploits the unsecured User Manager REST API and a ZIP file

        path traversal in Apache Jetspeed-2, version 2.3.0 and unknown earlier

        versions, to upload and execute a shell.



        Note: this exploit will create, use, and then delete a new admin user.



        Warning: in testing, exploiting the file upload clobbered the web

        interface beyond repair. No workaround has been found yet. Use this

        module at your own risk. No check will be implemented.
