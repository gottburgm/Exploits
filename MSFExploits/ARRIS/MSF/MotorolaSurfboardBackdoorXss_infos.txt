  "DESCRIPTION" => "



        The web interface for the Arris / Motorola Surfboard SBG6580 has

        several vulnerabilities that, when combined, allow an arbitrary website to take

        control of the modem, even if the user is not currently logged in. The attacker

        must successfully know, or guess, the target's internal gateway IP address.

        This is usually a default value of 192.168.0.1.



        First, a hardcoded backdoor account was discovered in the source code

        of one device with the credentials \"technician/yZgO8Bvj\". Due to lack of CSRF

        in the device's login form, these credentials - along with the default

        \"admin/motorola\" - can be sent to the device by an arbitrary website, thus

        inadvertently logging the user into the router.



        Once successfully logged in, a persistent XSS vulnerability is

        exploited in the firewall configuration page. This allows injection of

        Javascript that can perform any available action in the router interface.



        The following firmware versions have been tested as vulnerable:



        SBG6580-6.5.2.0-GA-06-077-NOSH, and

        SBG6580-8.6.1.0-GA-04-098-NOSH
