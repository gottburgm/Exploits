my $EXPLOIT = {
  CVE => "CVE-2010-2861",
  DESCRIPTION => "

          This module attempts to exploit the directory traversal in the 'locale'

        attribute.  According to the advisory the following versions are vulnerable:



        ColdFusion MX6 6.1 base patches,

        ColdFusion MX7 7,0,0,91690 base patches,

        ColdFusion MX8 8,0,1,195765 base patches,

        ColdFusion MX8 8,0,1,195765 with Hotfix4.



        Adobe released patches for ColdFusion 8.0, 8.0.1, and 9 but ColdFusion 9 is reported

        to have directory traversal protections in place, subsequently this module does NOT

        work against ColdFusion 9.  Adobe did not release patches for ColdFusion 6.1 or

        ColdFusion 7.



        It is not recommended to set FILE when doing scans across a group of servers where the OS

        may vary; otherwise, the file requested may not make sense for the OS
