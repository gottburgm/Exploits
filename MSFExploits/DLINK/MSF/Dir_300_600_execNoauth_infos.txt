  DESCRIPTION => "

          This module exploits an OS Command Injection vulnerability in some D-Link

        Routers like the DIR-600 rev B and the DIR-300 rev B. The vulnerability exists in

        command.php, which is accessible without authentication. This module has been

        tested with the versions DIR-600 2.14b01 and below, DIR-300 rev B 2.13 and below.

        In order to get a remote shell the telnetd could be started without any

        authentication.
