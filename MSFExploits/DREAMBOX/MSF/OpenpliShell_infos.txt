  DESCRIPTION => "

          Some Dream Boxes with OpenPLI v3 beta Images are vulnerable to OS command

        injection in the Webif 6.0.4 Web Interface. This is a blind injection, which means

        that you will not see any output of your command. A ping command can be used for

        testing the vulnerability.  This module has been tested in a box with the next

        features: Linux Kernel version 2.6.9 (build\@plibouwserver) (gcc version 3.4.4) #1

        Wed Aug 17 23:54:07 CEST 2011, Firmware release 1.1.0 (27.01.2013), FP Firmware

        1.06 and Web Interface 6.0.4-Expert (PLi edition).
