  DESCRIPTION => "

          This module exploits the chunked transfer integer wrap

        vulnerability in Apache version 1.2.x to 1.3.24. This

        particular module has been tested with all versions of the

        official Win32 build between 1.3.9 and 1.3.24. Additionally,

        it should work against most co-branded and bundled versions

        of Apache (Oracle 8i, 9i, IBM HTTPD, etc).



        You will need to use the Check() functionality to determine

        the exact target version prior to launching the exploit. The

        version of Apache bundled with Oracle 8.1.7 will not

        automatically restart, so if you use the wrong target value,

        the server will crash.
