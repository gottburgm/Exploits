my $EXPLOIT = {
  CVE => "CVE-2008-0506",
  DESCRIPTION => "

        This module exploits a vulnerability in the picEditor.php script of

        Coppermine Photo Gallery versions 1.4.14 and earlier. When configured to

        use the ImageMagick library, the 'quality', 'angle', and 'clipval'

        parameters are not properly escaped before being passed to the PHP

        'exec' command.



        In order to reach the vulnerable 'exec' call, the input must pass

        several validation steps.



        The vulnerabilities actually reside in the following functions:



        image_processor.php: rotate_image(...)

        include/imageObjectIM.class.php: imageObject::cropImage(...)

        include/imageObjectIM.class.php: imageObject::rotateImage(...)

        include/imageObjectIM.class.php: imageObject::resizeImage(...)

        include/picmgmt.inc.php: resize_image(...)



        NOTE: Use of the ImageMagick library is a non-default option. However, a

        user can specify its use at installation time.
