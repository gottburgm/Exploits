  CVE => "CVE-2012-4869",
  DESCRIPTION => "

        This module exploits FreePBX version 2.10.0,2.9.0 and possibly older.

        Due to the way callme_page.php handles the 'callmenum' parameter, it

        is possible to inject code to the '\$channel' variable in function

        callme_startcall in order to gain remote code execution.



        Please note in order to use this module properly, you must know the

        extension number, which can be enumerated or bruteforced, or you may

        try some of the default extensions such as 0 or 200.  Also, the call

        has to be answered (or go to voice).



        Tested on both Elastix and FreePBX ISO image installs.
