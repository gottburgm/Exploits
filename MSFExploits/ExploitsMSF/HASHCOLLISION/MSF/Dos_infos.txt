  CVE => "CVE-2011-4858",
  DESCRIPTION => "

        This module uses a denial-of-service (DoS) condition appearing in a variety of

        programming languages. This vulnerability occurs when storing multiple values

        in a hash table and all values have the same hash value. This can cause a web server

        parsing the POST parameters issued with a request into a hash table to consume

        hours of CPU with a single HTTP request.



        Currently, only the hash functions for PHP and Java are implemented.

        This module was tested with PHP + httpd, Tomcat, Glassfish and Geronimo.

        It also generates a random payload to bypass some IDS signatures.
