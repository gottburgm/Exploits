  DESCRIPTION => "

          This module exploits an integer overflow vulnerability in the unserialize()

        function of the PHP web server extension. This vulnerability was patched by

        Stefan in version 4.5.0 and applies all previous versions supporting this function.

        This particular module targets numerous web applications and is based on the proof

        of concept provided by Stefan Esser. This vulnerability requires approximately 900k

        of data to trigger due the multiple Cookie headers requirement. Since we

        are already assuming a fast network connection, we use a 2Mb block of shellcode for

        the brute force, allowing quick exploitation for those with fast networks.



        One of the neat things about this vulnerability is that on x86 systems, the EDI register points

        into the beginning of the hashtable string. This can be used with an egghunter to

        quickly exploit systems where the location of a valid \"jmp EDI\" or \"call EDI\" instruction

        is known. The EDI method is faster, but the bandwidth-intensive brute force used by this

        module is more reliable across a wider range of systems.
