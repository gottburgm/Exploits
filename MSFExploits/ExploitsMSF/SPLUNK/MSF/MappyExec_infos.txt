  "DESCRIPTION" => "

        This module abuses a command execution vulnerability in the

        web based interface of Splunk 4.2 to 4.2.4. The vulnerability exists

        in the 'mappy' search command which allows attackers to run Python code.

        To exploit this vulnerability, a valid Splunk user with the admin

        role is required. By default, this module uses the credential of \"admin:changeme\",

        the default Administrator credential for Splunk. Note that the Splunk web interface

        runs as SYSTEM on Windows and as root on Linux by default.
