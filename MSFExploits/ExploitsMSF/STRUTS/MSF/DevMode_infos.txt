  CVE => "CVE-2012-0394",
  DESCRIPTION => "

        This module exploits a remote command execution vulnerability in Apache

        Struts 2. The problem exists on applications running in developer mode,

        where the DebuggingInterceptor allows evaluation and execution of OGNL

        expressions, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary Java

        code. This module has been tested successfully on Struts 2.3.16, Tomcat

        7 and Ubuntu 10.04.
