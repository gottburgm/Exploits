  CVE => "CVE-2014-8517",
  DESCRIPTION => "

        This module exploits an arbitrary command execution vulnerability in

        tnftp's handling of the resolved output filename - called \"savefile\" in

        the source - from a requested resource.



        If tnftp is executed without the -o command-line option, it will resolve

        the output filename from the last component of the requested resource.



        If the output filename begins with a \"|\" character, tnftp will pass the

        fetched resource's output to the command directly following the \"|\"

        character through the use of the popen() function.
