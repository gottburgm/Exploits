  "DESCRIPTION" => "

        This module exploits multiple vulnerabilities in Visual Mining NetCharts.

        First, a lack of input validation in the administration console permits

        arbitrary jsp code upload to locations accessible later through the web

        service. Authentication is typically required, however a 'hidden' user is

        available by default (and non-editable). This user, named 'Scheduler',

        can only login to the console after any modification in the user

        database (a user is added, admin password is changed etc). If the

        'Scheduler' user isn't available valid credentials must be supplied. The

        default Admin password is Admin.
