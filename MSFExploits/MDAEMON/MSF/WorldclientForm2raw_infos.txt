  CVE => "CVE-2003-1200",
  DESCRIPTION => "

      This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in Alt-N MDaemon SMTP server for

      versions 6.8.5 and earlier. When WorldClient HTTP server is installed (default),

      a CGI script is provided to accept html FORM based emails and deliver via MDaemon.exe,

      by writing the CGI output to the Raw Queue. When X-FromCheck is enabled (also default),

      the temporary form2raw.cgi data is copied by MDaemon.exe and a stack based

      overflow occurs when an excessively long From field is specified.

      The RawQueue is processed every 1 minute by default, to a maximum of 60 minutes.

      Keep this in mind when choosing payloads or setting WfsDelay... You'll need to wait.



      Furthermore, this exploit uses a direct memory jump into a nopsled (which isn't very

      reliable). Once the payload is written into the Raw Queue by Form2Raw, MDaemon will

      continue to crash/execute the payload until the CGI output is manually deleted

      from the queue in C:\\MDaemon\\RawFiles\\*.raw.
