  CVE => "CVE-2004-1315",
  DESCRIPTION => "

          This module exploits two arbitrary PHP code execution flaws in the

        phpBB forum system. The problem is that the 'highlight' parameter

        in the 'viewtopic.php' script is not verified properly and will

        allow an attacker to inject arbitrary code via preg_replace().



        This vulnerability was introduced in revision 3076, and finally

        fixed in revision 5166. According to the \"tags\" within their tree,

        this corresponds to versions 2.0.4 through 2.0.15 (inclusive).
