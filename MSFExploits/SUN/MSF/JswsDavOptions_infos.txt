  CVE => "CVE-2010-0361",
  DESCRIPTION => "

          This module exploits a buffer overflow in Sun Java Web Server prior to

        version 7 Update 8. By sending an \"OPTIONS\" request with an overly long

        path, attackers can execute arbitrary code. In order to reach the vulnerable

        code, the attacker must also specify the path to a directory with WebDAV

        enabled.



        This exploit was tested and confirmed to work on Windows XP SP3 without DEP.

        Versions for other platforms are vulnerable as well.



        The vulnerability was originally discovered and disclosed by Evgeny Legerov of

        Intevydis.
