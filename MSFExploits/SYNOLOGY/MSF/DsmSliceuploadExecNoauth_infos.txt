  "DESCRIPTION" => "

        This module exploits a vulnerability found in Synology DiskStation Manager (DSM)

        versions 4.x, which allows the execution of arbitrary commands under root

        privileges.

        The vulnerability is located in /webman/imageSelector.cgi, which allows to append

        arbitrary data to a given file using a so called SLICEUPLOAD functionality, which

        can be triggered by an unauthenticated user with a specially crafted HTTP request.

        This is exploited by this module to append the given commands to /redirect.cgi,

        which is a regular shell script file, and can be invoked with another HTTP request.

        Synology reported that the vulnerability has been fixed with versions 4.0-2259,

        4.2-3243, and 4.3-3810 Update 1, respectively; the 4.1 branch remains vulnerable.
