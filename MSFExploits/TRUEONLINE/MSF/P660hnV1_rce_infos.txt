  DESCRIPTION => "

        TrueOnline is a major ISP in Thailand, and it distributes a customized version of

        the ZyXEL P660HN-T v1 router. This customized version has an unauthenticated command

        injection vulnerability in the remote log forwarding page.

        This module was tested in an emulated environment, as the author doesn't have access to the

        Thai router any more. Any feedback should be sent directly to the module's author, as well as

        to the Metasploit project.

        There are other language strings in the firmware, so it is likely that this firmware is not only

        distributed in Thailand. Other P660HN-T v1 in other countries might be vulnerable too.
