my $EXPLOIT = {
  CVE => "CVE-2015-0779",
  DESCRIPTION => "

        This module exploits a file upload vulnerability in Novell ZENworks Configuration

        Management (ZCM, which is part of the ZENworks Suite). The vulnerability exists in

        the UploadServlet which accepts unauthenticated file uploads and does not check the

        \"uid\" parameter for directory traversal characters. This allows an attacker to write

        anywhere in the file system, and can be abused to deploy a WAR file in the Tomcat

        webapps directory. ZCM up to (and including) 11.3.1 is vulnerable to this attack.

        This module has been tested successfully with ZCM 11.3.1 on Windows and Linux. Note

        that this is a similar vulnerability to ZDI-10-078 / OSVDB-63412 which also has a

        Metasploit exploit, but it abuses a different parameter of the same servlet.
